## Hi there 👋
This is an invite only community of startup founders and businessmen who support each other in building great products.

We are a community of passionate folks interested in Business, Startups & Tech. We believe in helping others grow, and grow with the team in the process.

Get better at your skills, meet people with whom you can partner and work on projects, or just put on the work music and deep dive into work.

We are industry and designation agnostic.
